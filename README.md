# 📊 Global Population Distribution Analysis – Task 01

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The objective was to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable (population) using real-world country-level data.

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze and visualize population distribution across countries and identify the most populated nations using Python-based data analysis tools.

## 📂 Dataset
World Bank Country-wise Population Dataset

## 🔍 Approach & Methodology
- Imported and explored dataset using Pandas  
- Performed data cleaning and filtering to retain relevant country data  
- Extracted population values for the year 2022  
- Sorted data to identify top 10 most populated countries  
- Visualized results using a bar chart with Matplotlib  

## 📊 Key Insights
- India and China dominate global population figures.
- A noticeable population gap exists between the top two countries and others.
- Data visualization effectively highlights global population concentration patterns.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Data Visualization  

## 📈 Output
The final visualization clearly represents the population distribution among top countries, demonstrating practical skills in data loading, filtering, sorting, and graphical representation.
